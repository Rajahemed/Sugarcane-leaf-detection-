Overview
This project aims to detect sugarcane leaf diseases using a CNN-based deep learning model. It classifies leaf images into different disease categories like rust, red rot, and mosaic, helping farmers take early action to improve crop yield.

Technologies Used
Python (Programming)
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
OpenCV, PIL (Image Processing)
Google Colab/Jupyter (Model Training)
Flask/Streamlit (Deployment)
AWS/GPU (Acceleration)
Dataset
The dataset consists of healthy and diseased sugarcane leaf images. It is preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation before training the CNN model.
