Overview
This project aims to detect sugarcane leaf diseases using a CNN-based deep learning model. It classifies leaf images into different disease categories like rust, red rot, and mosaic, helping farmers take early action to improve crop yield.

Technologies Used
Python (Programming)
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
OpenCV, PIL (Image Processing)
Google Colab/Jupyter (Model Training)
Flask/Streamlit (Deployment)
AWS/GPU (Acceleration)
Dataset
The dataset consists of healthy and diseased sugarcane leaf images. It is preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation before training the CNN model.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sugarcane-leaf-disease.git
cd sugarcane-leaf-disease
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Start the web application:
bash

python app.py
Usage
Upload an image of a sugarcane leaf.
The model predicts whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.
If diseased, it classifies the disease type and suggests possible treatments.
Future Enhancements
Improve model accuracy with Transfer Learning.
Deploy as a mobile app for real-time detection.
Integrate with an IoT system for automated monitoring.
